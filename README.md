_bolt.chat_ is intended as a modern replacement for [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat).
I started this project because I feel like there aren't many open source chat protocols that follow modern
standards.

Not only do I think it's a great fit for an IRC replacement; it might even be suitable for a replacement of
present-day proprietary protocols and chat applications, such as Discord and Slack. _bolt.chat_ comes with
a nifty text-base user interface, but since it uses its own protocol, it's possible to build a GUI client
in, say, Electron. (please don't, use [Tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri))
